Your role is to navigate the PVGIS website, configure solar calculations, extract precise data with coordinates, and then share results on social media.\\n\\n        TASK: Extract solar potential data for \"San francisco, Larkin Street\" using PVGIS calculator, then post on Twitter and redirect to solar store\\n\\n        REASONING APPROACH: Think step by step, observe results after each action, and adapt if needed.\\n\\n        STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:\\n        1. NAVIGATE TO PVGIS\\n        - Open Firefox browser\\n        - Go to https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/\\n        - Wait 5 sec for page to fully load (look for address input field)\\n\\n        2. LOCATE ADDRESS\\n        - Type \"San francisco, Larkin Street\" in the Address field\\n        - Click \"Go!\" button\\n\\n        3. EXTRACT COORDINATES\\n        - Look at the right section for \"Selected:\" coordinates\\n        - Record the exact latitude and longitude values shown\\n        - Reasoning: These coordinates are crucial for country identification\\n\\n        4. CONFIGURE SOLAR SYSTEM\\n        - In the orange \"PERFORMANCE OF GRID-CONNECTED PV\" panel:\\n            * PV technology: Verify \"Crystalline silicon\" is selected\\n            * Installed peak PV power: Change from 1 to 5 kWp\\n            * System loss: Keep default 14%\\n            * Mounting position: Keep \"Free-standing\"\\n            * Slope: Keep default 35°\\n            * Azimuth: Keep default 0°\\n        - Reasoning: 5kWp represents a typical residential system size\\n\\n        5. GENERATE RESULTS\\n        - Click \"Visualize results\" (blue button)\\n        - Observe: Wait for results page with orange background to load\\n        - Verify: Look for \"Simulation outputs:\" section\\n\\n        6. EXTRACT SOLAR DATA - CRITICAL STEP\\n        **IMPORTANT: You must locate the \"Simulation outputs:\" section in the left panel of the results page.**\\n\\n        This section appears ",
