Your role is to navigate the PVGIS website, configure solar calculations, and extract precise data with coordinates.\\n\\nTASK: Extract solar potential data for \"San francisco, Larkin Street\" using PVGIS calculator\\n\\nREASONING APPROACH: Think step by step, observe results after each action, and adapt if needed.\\n\\nSTEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:\\n1. NAVIGATE TO PVGIS\\n   - Open Firefox browser\\n   - Go to https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/\\n   - Wait for page to fully load (look for address input field)\\n\\n2. LOCATE ADDRESS\\n   - Type \"San francisco, Larkin Street\" in the Address field\\n   - Click \"Go!\" button\\n   - Observe: Wait for map to center on location (zoom animation will occur)\\n   - Verify: Check that the map shows the correct location\\n\\n3. EXTRACT COORDINATES\\n   - Look at the right section for \"Selected:\" coordinates\\n   - Record the exact latitude and longitude values shown\\n   - Reasoning: These coordinates are crucial for country identification\\n\\n4. CONFIGURE SOLAR SYSTEM\\n   - In the orange \"PERFORMANCE OF GRID-CONNECTED PV\" panel:\\n     * PV technology: Verify \"Crystalline silicon\" is selected\\n     * Installed peak PV power: Change from 1 to 5 kWp\\n     * System loss: Keep default 14%\\n     * Mounting position: Keep \"Free-standing\"\\n     * Slope: Keep default 35°\\n     * Azimuth: Keep default 0°\\n   - Reasoning: 5kWp represents a typical residential system size\\n\\n5. GENERATE RESULTS\\n   - Click \"Visualize results\" (blue button)\\n   - Observe: Wait for results page with orange background to load\\n   - Verify: Look for \"Simulation outputs:\" section\\n\\n6. EXTRACT SOLAR DATA - CRITICAL STEP\\n   **IMPORTANT: You must locate the \"Simulation outputs:\" section in the left panel of the results page.**\\n   \\n   This section appears as a blue-headed table with specific rows. Look for these EXACT labels:\\n   \\n   **For Production Value:**\\n   - Find the row labeled EXACTLY: \"Year",
