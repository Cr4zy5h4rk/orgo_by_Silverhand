Open Firefox browser\\n        2. Navigate to: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/\\n        3. Wait for the page to fully load (you should see a map and input fields)\\n        4. Locate the \"Address:\" input field on the left side\\n        5. Clear any existing text and type: \"San francisco, Larkin Street\"\\n        6. Click the \"Go!\" button next to the address field\\n        7. Wait 5-10 seconds for the map to center and load the location\\n        8. Look at the RIGHT panel - find the \"Selected:\" coordinates (format: XX.XXX, Y.YYY)\\n        9. Note these coordinates for later\\n        \\n        10. In the ORANGE \"PERFORMANCE OF GRID-CONNECTED PV\" panel on the right:\\n            - Verify \"PV technology\" shows \"Crystalline silicon\"\\n            - Change \"Installed peak PV power [kWp]\" from 1 to 5\\n            - Keep \"System loss [%]\" at 14\\n            - Keep \"Mounting position\" as \"Free-standing\"\\n            - Keep \"Slope [°]\" at 35\\n            - Keep \"Azimuth [°]\" at 0\\n        \\n        11. Click the BLUE \"Visualize results\" button\\n        12. Wait 10-15 seconds for the results page to load (orange background)\\n        13. Scroll down to find the \"Simulation outputs:\" section\\n        14. Look for these exact lines and copy the numbers:\\n            - \"Yearly PV energy production [kWh]: XXXX.XX\"\\n            - \"Yearly in-plane irradiation [kWh/m²]: XXXX.XX\"\\n        \\n        CRITICAL: If the site doesn\\'t work or takes too long:\\n        - Try refreshing the page once\\n        - If still failing, report what you see and provide coordinates only\\n        \\n        MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:\\n        \"EXTRACTED DATA:\\n        Coordinates: [latitude], [longitude]\\n        Production: [production_value] kWh\\n    ",
